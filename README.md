## Project Overview

Welcome to Pawsome Adoptions, a website designed to connect dog lovers with their future furry companions. The project focuses on providing a seamless user experience through a login system, a dynamic search page, and innovative features to enhance the adoption process.

### Login System

The website begins with a required login form, ensuring a personalized experience for users. The login form interacts with the API's authentication endpoint, granting users access to the rich content available.

### Search Page

Once authenticated, users are directed to a visually appealing search page. The heart of the website, this page showcases item cards for various dogs available for adoption, sourced from the API. The layout is designed for easy navigation and a delightful browsing experience.

### Dynamic Filtering

Empowering users to find their ideal pet, the search page incorporates filter options for breed, age, and location. Users can customize their search preferences and explore dogs that match their criteria. Sorting options based on different styles further enhance the search experience.

### Favorites and Perfect Match

Pawsome Adoptions introduces a unique feature allowing users to mark their favorite dogs by clicking on their cards. These favorites are stored locally, and users can generate their perfect match by submitting their selections to the API using a POST request.

### Technologies Used

- **React JS:** Chosen for its flexibility and ability to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Employed to streamline the styling process and maintain a clean, consistent design across the website.
- **TypeScript:** Used to enhance code maintainability and catch potential errors early in the development process.

### Challenges

The project presented a set of challenges, notably in mastering the proper implementations of TypeScript with React JS. While learning to integrate TypeScript, I sought to leverage its benefits for improved code quality and developer productivity.

Additionally, implementing a robust location search filter system proved to be a challenge, but it was essential for enhancing user search capabilities.

Navigating first-time experiences with React JS and GitHub Pages involved overcoming some learning curves. Successfully deploying the website live required understanding how to integrate [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) properly and use of [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages).

### Future Updates

Pawsome Adoptions is an evolving project with plans for expansion. Future updates will include the addition of essential pages such as a homepage, detailed product views for dog cards, and dedicated pages for contact and about information. These enhancements aim to provide users with a more comprehensive and engaging platform for their adoption journey.
